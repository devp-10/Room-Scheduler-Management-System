### Description:
In this project, I developed a room scheduling application (GUI and database driven) for a tiny college. Consider the college to have only one building in which rooms are to be scheduled. The college can reserve one room per Date per faculty, for each Date the rooms are available. The rooms are reserved by Faculty name. Faculty can request a room reservation for a specific Date based on the number of seats they require. The room is assigned by the program, and faculty does not get to request a specific room. Each Date is just a specific Date. Faculty are identified by a single name.
